<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is part of the full-stack solution I developed for the Canadian Journal of Undergraduate Research in August 2020 as a proof-of-concept for a new website. Due to an adware attack that summer and financial difficulties at the journal, a move from WordPress to a JAMstack design was planned: the WordPress backend would be retained as a headless local instance, while a Gatsby application would generate a static site by sending GraphQL queries to the backend and compiling this data into markup and media files. These files would have been served on a free distribution - the live demonstration was deployed to AWS S3 and CloudFront. This was intended to totally eliminate the cost of hosting the WordPress site without abandoning WordPress, a red line of the editors'. This arrangement necessitated a change to the editorial board's workflow, as the WordPress site now needed to be backed up on each revision for distribution to the rest of the board. To keep the work of the editors' simple I also wrote a pair of executable Python scripts, one to initialize a development preview, and another to build the site and make the files ready for upload.</p>
<p>The website was never put online; not long after I had completed development the Journal's parent organization pooled their respective online resources together, minimizing costs to an acceptable sum, although I proceeded to integrate some elements of the front-end design in this mock-up to the WordPress site and move asset files to a cloud distribution for better performance. As the Gatsby application requires a live local version of the CJUR WordPress backend, I have divided that and the Python scripts from the static site files, which can be found in <a href="https://github.com/dssutanto/public-cjur/">this repo</a>; I have not made CJUR's backend publicly available on ethical grounds.</p>
